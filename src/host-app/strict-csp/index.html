    <h1>
      This page has <code>require-trusted-types-for 'script'</code> required in
      the CSP rules.
    </h1>
    <h2>
      The combination of that attribute being in the CSP rules, along with the
      <code>trusted-types</code>
      attribute also being present and NOT specifying the name of the
      dynamically-loaded content policy, means that the browser will fail to
      load the dynamic code in all three cases.)
    </h2>

    <div style="margin-bottom: 10px">
      <h3>
        Case 1: Load dynamic code, no policy defined in the webpack config
      </h3>
      <div>
        This button will fail to work, failing with the following error:
      </div>
      <code
        >Failed to set the 'src' property on 'HTMLScriptElement': This document
        requires 'TrustedScriptURL' assignment.</code
      >
      <button id="load-code-with-no-policy">
        Load dynamic code, no policy defined in the webpack config
      </button>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 10px">
      <h3>
        Case 2: Load dynamic code, with only the policy defined in config (and
        the default behavior of stopping on policy-creation failure)
      </h3>
      <div>
        This second button also fails to work, this time because trusted-types
        is now defined in the Webpack config for the dynamic code, and yet isn't
        in the
        <code>trusted-types</code> allow-list of the CSP.
      </div>
      <div>
        The failure is identical to what happened on the "report-only" page for
        this same case:
      </div>
      <code
        >Failed to execute 'createPolicy' on 'TrustedTypePolicyFactory': Policy
        "DynamicWebpackCode" disallowed.</code
      >
      <button id="load-code-with-policy-name-only">
        Load dynamic code, with only the policy defined in config (and the
        default behavior of stopping on policy-creation failure)
      </button>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 10px">
      <h3>
        Case 3: Load dynamic code, with a webpack config that allows
        continuation on policy-creation failure
      </h3>
      <div>
        Finally, this last button has the new
        <code>onPolicyCreationFailure: "continue"</code>
        option in the dynamic code's webpack config. However, because we are in
        strict mode, it will still fail in the exact same way as Case 1 fails
        (with the only difference being a few more errors and warnings on the
        console).
      </div>
      <button id="load-code-with-continue-on-policy-creation-failure">
        Load dynamic code, with a webpack config that allows continuation on
        policy-creation failure
      </button>
    </div>

    <hr />
    <h3>Result:</h3>
    <div>
      Click one of the buttons above to see the result (and compare it with what
      happens in the <a href="../report-only-csp/">"report-only-csp"</a> case).
    </div>
    <div id="result"></div>
