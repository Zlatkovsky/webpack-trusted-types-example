    <h1>
      This page has <code>require-trusted-types-for 'script'</code> enabled via
      CSP, but in <b>Report Only</b> mode.
    </h1>
    <h2>
      Importantly, `trusted-types` itself is enabled in the CSP, and does NOT
      have the name of the policy for the dynamically-loaded content (e.g.,
      imagine it's an old/cached copy of the application, that isn't aware of
      the new policy).
    </h2>

    <div style="margin-bottom: 10px">
      <div>
        This first button will work. There will be a warning outputted to the
        console by the browser (<code
          >[Report Only] This document requires 'TrustedScriptURL'
          assignment.</code
        >), but in other respects the code will run fine:
      </div>
      <button id="load-code-with-no-policy">
        Load dynamic code, no policy defined in the webpack config
      </button>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 10px">
      <div>
        This second button FAILS to work, because trusted-types is now defined
        in the Webpack config for the dynamic code, and yet isn't in the
        <code>trusted-types</code> allow-list of the CSP.
      </div>
      <button id="load-code-with-policy-name-only">
        Load dynamic code, with only the policy defined in config (and the
        default behavior of stopping on policy-creation failure)
      </button>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 10px">
      <div>
        Finally, this last button has the new
        <code>onPolicyCreationFailure: "continue"</code>
        option in the dynamic code's webpack config, and so it will output a
        couple of warnings to the console and then work just like the first
        button:
      </div>
      <button id="load-code-with-continue-on-policy-creation-failure">
        Load dynamic code, with a webpack config that allows continuation on
        policy-creation failure
      </button>

      <div>See this image for what the warnings look like:</div>
